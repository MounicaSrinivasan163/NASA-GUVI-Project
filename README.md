NASA asteroid tracker - Python - Sql - Streamlit 

    This project analyzes **Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)** — asteroids and comets that come close to Earth, using data provided by **NASA's NEO API**.

    ### 📌 Purpose
    - Track and explore close-approaching asteroids
    - Analyze velocity, distance, size, and hazard status
    - Help raise awareness and understanding of asteroid behaviors

    ### 🛰 Data Source
    - NASA's [Near-Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs)](https://api.nasa.gov/)
    - Updated regularly with new asteroid observations

    ### 🔍 Key Features
    - Predefined SQL queries to explore the dataset
    - Identify hazardous asteroids
    - Analyze approach frequency and velocities
    - Explore which asteroids passed closest to Earth

    ### 👨‍💻 Tools Used
    - **Python** with **Streamlit** for the interface
    - **MySQL** for structured data storage
    - **Pandas** for data handling
    - **NASA APIs** for real-world data
